Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications when events occur on your Mobipurse merchant account. This is the most reliable way to track payment status and other important events.

## How Webhooks Work

When a significant event occurs (such as a payment completion), Mobipurse sends an HTTP POST request to the webhook URL you've configured. Your server should acknowledge receipt by responding with a `200 OK` status code.

## Setting Up Webhooks

You can configure your webhook URL in two ways:

1. **Per-checkout basis**: Include the `webhookURL` parameter when creating a checkout
2. **Global webhook**: Set a default webhook URL in your dashboard under **Settings → Webhooks**

### Webhook Priority

If a webhook URL is specified in the checkout creation request, it will be used. Otherwise, the global webhook URL from your dashboard settings will be used.

## Webhook Events

### checkout.completed

This event is triggered when a customer successfully completes a payment.
